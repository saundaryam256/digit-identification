This project demonstrates how an ANN can learn to recognize handwritten digits from pixel data.
It includes:

Model training using Keras
Saving/loading the trained model
A Streamlit interface (app.py) for user input and prediction

featuress :✔Preprocesses MNIST images
✔ Builds and trains an ANN model
✔ Visualizes loss & accuracy
✔ Saves trained model (.keras)
✔ Streamlit app to draw digits and get predictions
✔ Easy to run, beginner-friendly


The app.py file provides a web UI where users can draw a digit or upload an image, and the model will predict the number.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Streamlit
NumPy
